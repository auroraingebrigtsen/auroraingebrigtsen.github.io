        <h1>Our story starts with one man.</h1>
        <h4>Back in 1954, a man named Ray Kroc discovered a small burger restaurant in California, 
            and wrote the first page of our history. From humble beginnings as a small restaurant, 
            we're proud to have become one of the world's leading food service brands with more than 
            36,000 restaurants in more than 100 countries</h4>
