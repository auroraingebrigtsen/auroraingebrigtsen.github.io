            co-workers who wish to make good experiences, for both our guests and colleagues. Working at a McDonald's
            restaurant is more than just
            a paycheck. It's an opportunity to build a successful future with the perks and flexibility of a side gig.
            McDonald’s restaurants offer a variety of career development opportunities, ranging from world-class
            training programs to high school completion
            courses to colleague tuition assistance. Check with your local restaurant to learn more about what may be
            available to you. Whether you choose to work for a corporately-owned restaurant or with an independent
            franchisee organization, you will
            be inspired by the spirit and creativity that have made McDonald’s one of the world’s most-recognized
            brands. You have to like working in a team, enjoy working in a high pace and do a variety of tasks.</b>
